# RAG

RAG stands for "Retrieval-Augmented Generation," a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) that combines retrieval-based and generative models to improve the quality and relevance of generated responses. Here's a brief overview:

Retrieval Component: This part involves searching a large corpus or database to retrieve relevant information or documents based on a query. The retrieved content serves as context or additional information for the generative model.

Generative Component: A generative model, typically a transformer-based model like GPT-4, uses the information retrieved in the first step to generate a coherent and contextually appropriate response or output.

The combination of these two components allows for more accurate and informative responses, as the generative model has access to a wider range of context and factual information.
